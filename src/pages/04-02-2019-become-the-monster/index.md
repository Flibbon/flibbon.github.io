>What about 'Frankensteinteen: become the monster?'

_â€” McElroy, Griffin. "The Naming of 2019." Audio comedy show. My Brother My Brother and Me. Maximum Fun, 31 Dec. 2018. Web. 2 Apr. 2019._

It's 2019: everything is Bad. So get unironically into electro swing.

Watch the 1986 film _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_ four times in three days. Go back to school for some goddamn reason. Plan two separate trips to Europe for the same month. Pet cats. Sleep in. Create a private Twitter account and spend most of your time complaining on your public one.

Create things that aren't ever meant to be shared online. Draw terrible misshapen lines, sketches so poorly conceived and rendered that only you can tell what they were meant to be. Write stories and don't show them to anyone, ever. Pet more cats.

And update your stupid personal website, because you've been meaning to do it forever and you're tired of paying a service 100 actual dollars every year for something you can do on your own.

It's 20-Frankensteinteen. Become the monster.
